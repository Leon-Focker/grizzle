# grizzle
A wavetable instrument for Pure Data, which can transform live input or samples. A multi-voice, user-friendly but also more cpu-heavy version is available as **grizzle**. There is a more light-weight version **grizzle_module** and the super cpu-friendly but rather ugly version **grizzle_slim**.
